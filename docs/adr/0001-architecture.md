\# 0001 – Architecture \& Stack



\## Context

We need an enterprise-leaning demo (CRUD + AI) with fast free-tier deploy.



\## Decision

Spring Boot 3 + Angular 18 + MySQL (PlanetScale).  

API on Render; Web on Vercel.  

JWT auth. S3 (later) for attachments.



\## Status

Accepted – Phase 1



\## Consequences

Clear hiring signal: security, testing, CI/CD, modular API, modern Angular.  

PlanetScale serverless for frictionless MySQL.
